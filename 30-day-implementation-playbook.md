# 30-Day Implementation Playbook

You don’t need a reorg. You need a rhythm.

This 30-day playbook helps you start building a quality-first culture without approval chains, new tools, or massive process shifts. Just leadership and momentum.

---

## Goal:

Build the 3 core habits of quality leadership:

- Risk visibility
- Confidence alignment
- Shared ownership

---

## Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 **Week 1 — Start Small, Start Real**

- Identify one project or team to pilot the practice
- Schedule your first **Weekly Quality Review**
- Use the [Weekly Quality Review Agenda](./weekly-quality-review.md) to guide the meeting
- Assign confidence levels to major deliverables

Outcome: First WQR completed, confidence tracking begins

---

### 🔹 **Week 2 — Catch Risks Early**

- Run a [Pre-Mortem Quality Audit](./pre-mortem-quality-audits.md) on an upcoming change or launch
- Focus on assumptions, edge cases, and what success/failure looks like
- Log early signals and mitigation plans

Outcome: Risk surface expanded, assumptions documented, signals defined

---

### 🔹 **Week 3 — Activate Champions**

- Nominate 1–2 [Quality Champions](./quality-champion-playbook.md)
- Invite them to join planning/review meetings
- Encourage them to ask “what could go wrong?” in daily work

Outcome: Quality mindset spreads beyond QA roles

---

### 🔹 **Week 4 — Reflect & Expand**

- Hold a retrospective with the pilot team
- Ask: What did we catch earlier than usual? What still surprised us?
- Decide whether to scale to more teams

Outcome: Visible wins, reduced blind spots, team buy-in

---

## Repeating This Playbook

Once you complete 30 days with one team:

- Start a new 30-day cycle with 1–2 more teams
- Let Champions lead WQRs
- Track compound quality improvements over time (fewer last-minute bugs, stronger confidence, reduced rework)

---

## Final Thought

You’re not fixing everything in 30 days.
You’re installing **a new rhythm of quality leadership**.

Start small. Stay consistent. Let momentum lead the culture shift.
