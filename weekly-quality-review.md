# Weekly Quality Review (WQR)

A 30-minute leadership-level session to identify risk, align confidence, and prevent 3AM incidents before they happen.

---

## Suggested Time:

**Every Monday or Sprint Planning Day** — 30 minutes

---

## Agenda

### 1. Risk Assessment (10 min)

- What’s new, fast, or unstable this week?
- What assumptions are we relying on?
- Any external changes (AI rollouts, infra updates, deadlines)?

### 2. Confidence Levels (10 min)

- For key deliverables: what’s our current confidence (High, Medium, Low)?
- What signals are we using to measure that?
- Are any critical areas “guess-driven” vs. data-informed?

### 3. Action Items (10 min)

- What do we need to test, validate, or review this week?
- What’s our mitigation plan for the riskiest item?
- Who owns the follow-ups?
